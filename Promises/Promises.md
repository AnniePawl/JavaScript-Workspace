A promise is an object that represent work that will be done in teh future. 

Promise can be in one of three states:
- **Pending** In process 
- **Resolved** Work Completed Successfully 
- **Rejected** Work failed 

## Defining a promise 
- Provide one function 
- then() gets results from promise 
- catch() to handle error 



# Problems to solve

1) What happens when a promise is rejected?

2) What happens when you call both resolve and reject? 

3) Does the order matter? 

4) What happens if you call resolve or reject more than once?
